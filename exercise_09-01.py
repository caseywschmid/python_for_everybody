# Exercise 1: Download a copy of the file www.py4e.com/code3/words.txt Write a
# program that reads the words in words.txt and stores them as keys in a
# dictionary. It doesnâ€™t matter what the values are. Then you can use the in
# operator as a fast way to check whether a string is in the dictionary.
